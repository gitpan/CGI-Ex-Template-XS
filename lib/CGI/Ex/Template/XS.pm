=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module was the precursor to Template::Alloy::XS.  CGI::Ex::Template::XS
is now deprecated in favor of using Template::Alloy::XS.  No further work
will be done on the CGI::Ex::Template::XS line - all work will go into the
Template::Alloy line.

All code should work as before.
